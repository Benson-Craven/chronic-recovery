                    <p>
                        We may, at our option, keep track of visits to our Web
                        site via an automatic monitoring program that tells us,
                        among other things, how many visits are made to the
                        site; the time of day and date of those visits; and the
                        areas visited. This information may be used to evaluate
                        the effectiveness of our site and any promotion of our
                        site. It helps us determine whether we are distributing
                        information that is useful, helps us identify which
                        information is most useful and where and how users have
                        found our site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This process does not provide us with other information,
                        such as personal information about a visitor. We cannot
                        discern the name, address or any other personal
                        information about visitors to our site. If we were to
                        gather personal information, it would be directly
                        requested through a form you provide voluntarily and
                        each form will describe the manner in which information
                        will be used.

                    <h2 className="font-butler">How We Use Information</h2>

                        placing an order only to complete that order. We do not
                        share this information with outside parties except to
                        the extent necessary to complete that order.

                        We use return email addresses to answer the email we
                        receive. Such addresses are not used for any other
                        purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        better design our website and to share with advertisers.
                        For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of
                        individuals visited a certain area on our website, or
                        that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out
                        our registration form, but we would not disclose
                        anything that could be used to identify those
                        individuals.
